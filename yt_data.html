<h1>Trending YouTube Videos Dataset</h1>
<a href="index.html">Go Back to Home Page</a><br><br>

<p>YouTube has a propietary algorithm to determine which of its videos become trending.
  A Kaggle dataset exists to further analyze which videos started to trend. The dataset
  was collected using the YouTube API and contains data for different countries in different
  csv files. The dataset can be found here:

  ">Kaggle Page for Trending YouTube Videos</a>. On this page, I will share some of the insights I gathered.</p>
  <h2>Visualizations</h2>

  in this dataset are views, comment count, and likes; thus, I will focus my analysis on those variables.<br />
<p>We can interpret these results in a systematic fashion. The top left chart of views and comment counts indicates
  to us that the middle 50% of videos have a linear relationship between views and comment counts. The interesting
  behavior comes when we look at the top quartile and see that some videos have tremendously high comment counts
  but low view count. The top right graph again shows us the irregular distibution of views and comment count. </p>
  <p>The bottom left graph shows us that most videos on YouTube have a low number of likes and a low number of comments.
    The bottom right graph shows us that the relationship between views and comment count is irregular.
<h2>Correlations</h2>

Here, we see that there is a high correlation between a video's likes and views: 0.84. The next highest correlation is between
comment count and likes: 0.80. The lowest correlation is between comment count and views.
<h4>Multivariate Linear Regression</h4>

Regression Equation: Y = -928.8 - 0.001167(views) + 0.1634(likes)<br>
Every additional views has almost no effect (-0.001) on the dependent variable comment count. Each additional like has a large effect on number of comments.
<h2>Insights</h2>
1. Surprisingly, the number of views has very little effect on the number of comments on a video with high significance. <br>
2. The greatest concentration in the dataset lies at minimal views and minimal likes: meaning many videos have few to no views.<br>
3. The number of likes directly increases the number of comments on a video with high significance.<br>
4. Some videos with fewer likes have more comments than videos with more likes<br>
