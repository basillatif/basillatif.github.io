Hi. I would like to share my finding about Object-Oriented Design.
<p>4 ***KEY*** PRINCIPLES OF OBJECT-ORIENED DESIGN:</p>
  <p>(1) SINGLE RESPONSIBILITY PRINCIPLE,</p>
    <p>(2) OPEN CLOSED PRINCIPLE & STRATEGY PATTERN,</p>
    <p>(3) DEPENDENCY INVERSION,</p>
    <p>(4) LISKOV SUBSTITUATION,</p>
    <p>(5)</p>
    <p>(6) INTERFACE SEGRATION PRINCIPLE </p>

<(1) SINGLE RESPONSIBILITY PRINCIPLE>
The single responsibility principle states that each class should only have a single responsibility.
