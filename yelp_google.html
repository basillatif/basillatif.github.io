<p>The above chart shows the average rating by platform per $ category which denotes price. Across the board, the ratings on Google are higher than Yelp. The implication for restaurants is that it might be worthwhile to focus more energy on marketing and improving customer satisfaction on Yelp because it is harder to have happy customers on there. For consumers, Yelp might be a source of more honest reviews since the ratings are lower showing that people are more comfortable expressing a unfavorable opinion there. The platforms need to make sure that there user interfaces are such that they promote an honest and fair channel for restaurants and customers alike. One implication may be that the Google user interface promotes better reviews or that happy people like to post on Google. </p>
