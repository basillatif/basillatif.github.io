<p style="font-size:20px">I have degrees in Computer Science, Philosophy, and Data Analytics.</p>
<p style="font-size:20px">I was fascinated by big data analytics. I am currently in a few Kaggle contests, and I am always studying Machine Learning.</p>
<p style="font-size:20px">Besides data analytics, I enjoy playing 2v2 basketball,
watching cerebral movies, and finding ways to do interesting things on the Internet.</p>
