<h1>Predicting the Score of the Chiefs vs the 49ers in Super Bowl LIV</h1>
<h2>
  I worked on a project to forecast the score of the super bowl using machine
  learning.
</h2>
We built a linear regression model, a random forest model, and an XG Boost model
to peform prediction running several scenarios with different assumptions. We
delivered a presentation of our prediction methodology to an auditorium at the
Paul Merage School of Business.

<h3>
  Our final model combined all of the previos models to give a score of 28-26
  for the Chiefs which was off by 9 points from the actual score.

<h2>
  All the models were given equal weight to generate the final prediction. This
  method of ensemble modeling is championed by many skilled foreacasters.
