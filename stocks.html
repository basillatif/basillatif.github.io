    The stock market is a rich data source that can be used to implement
    analytics and data science techniques. Every stock has price that changes by
    the second and associated daily, monthly, and yearly volume with open and
    close prices.<br />
  </p>
<p>
  I have made a great effort to analyze stock prices to figure out predictive
  signals and long-term trends.

<h1 style="text-align: center">Predicting Long Term Price Trends</h1>
<div class="center">
  <p>
In one project at UC Irvine, I worked with a team of 3 other students to find the best
predictive algorithm to determine future stock price. For our analysis, we focused on
the FAANG technology stocks: Facebook, Apple, Amazon, Netflix, and Google.

<h1 style="text-align: center">3 Data Science Algorithms to Predict Future Price Based on Previous Prices</h1>
<div class="center">
  <p>Stock price is largely determined by investor sentiment and predictions of future gains. Several key economic theories are at
  play when one tries to predict a stock price. For one, the current price is supposed to reflect future prices. Further, the  perceived
  strength of economy also plays a role in stock prices.</p>
  <p>Our analysis looked at stock prices for technology companies over the last 5 years. It is important 2 things. First, the technology
    sector has done exceptionally well in the past 2 decades and has seen larger gains than the rest of the economy as a whole. Secondly,
    we are in the midst of a tremendous bull market. Since the recession of 2008, stock prices have risen significantly. Both of these factors
    impact why our models were able to perform so well.

  <h3 style="text-align: center">Monte Carlo Simulation</h3>
  <div class="center">
1. Monte Carlo Simulation - we used the famous Monte Carlo simulation to generate predictions for future prices for Google's stock.
According to investopedia, "Monte Carlosimulations are used to model the probability of different outcomes in a process
that cannot easily be predicted due to the intervention of random variables. It
is a technique used to understand the impact of risk and uncertainty in
prediction and forecasting models." The graph below shows that most of the simulations (lines) lie in the middle of the chart and go slightly up.
The Monte Carlo simulation for Google's stock price shows a positive trend for 2017.  <br />

<h3 style="text-align: center">Long Short-Term Memory</h3>
<div class="center">
2. Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) - below is a LSTM projection. According to
Machine Learning Mastery, "Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks are a type of
recurrent neural network capable of learning order dependence in sequence
prediction problems. This is a behavior required in complex problem domains like
machine translation, speech recognition, and more. We were able to generate a highly accurate LSTM graph for the
future growth of Amazon stock. Our prediction for 2017 and 2018 is shown in the orange line. It was backtested
against the actual price during that period shown in the red line. As the graph shows, our prediction is very close to the actual values.<br />

<h3 style="text-align: center">Facebook Prophet</h3>
<div class="center">
3. Facebook Prophet was developed by the Data Science Team at Facebook: "Prophet is
a procedure for forecasting time series data based on an additive model where
non-linear trends are fit with yearly, weekly, and daily seasonality, plus
holiday effects. It works best with time series that have strong seasonal
effects and several seasons of historical data. Prophet is robust to missing
data and shifts in the trend, and typically handles outliers well."

our prediction, we generate the output graph for the price of Amazon's stock.

<h2 style="text-align: center">Predicting Future Price By Correlating to Economic Indicators</h2>
<div class="center">
  <p>In graduate school, I had a professor who thought stock prices could be accurately predicted by correlating
     to economic indicators. I was assigned to predict the price of Goldman Sachs stock a year down the line. Below is my dashboard output</p>
     <img src="/charts/GS_Forecast.png" alt="GS Forecast " style="width:1000px;height:600px;" />
     Here, we see a GDP forecast for the end of 2020 at less than 100 units. We then see there is not a strong correlation between stock price
     and GDP in the bottom right graph. In the far left graph, we predict the future price to be just above $200.

     You can read about how we developed a system to read in a quarterly earnings
     call transcript and use it to predict the next day's stock price. <a href="https://medium.com/@bazill_theG/predicting-stock-price-using-natural-language-processing-8d469bb53de0"
