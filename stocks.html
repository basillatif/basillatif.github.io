<h3>Stock Market Data Analysis and Prediction</h3>
<p>
  The stock market is a rich data source that can be used to implement analytics
  and data science techniques. Every stock has price that changes by the second
  and associated daily, monthly, and yearly volume with open and close
  prices.<br />
</p>

<p>
  I have made a great effort to analyze stock prices to figure out predictive
  signals and long-term trends.

<h2>3 Algorithms/Tools to Predict Future Price Based on Previous Prices</h2>
1. Monte Carlo Simulation - below is a picture of what all of the simulations
look like when put on one graph. According to investopedia, "Monte Carlo
simulations are used to model the probability of different outcomes in a process
that cannot easily be predicted due to the intervention of random variables. It
is a technique used to understand the impact of risk and uncertainty in
prediction and forecasting models." <br />

2. Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) - below is a LSTM projection. According to
Machine Learning Mastery, "Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks are a type of
recurrent neural network capable of learning order dependence in sequence
prediction problems. This is a behavior required in complex problem domains like
machine translation, speech recognition, and more.<br />

<p>A Facebook Prophet Simulation Below</p>
Facebook Prophet was developed by the Data Science Team at Facebook: "Prophet is
a procedure for forecasting time series data based on an additive model where
non-linear trends are fit with yearly, weekly, and daily seasonality, plus
holiday effects. It works best with time series that have strong seasonal
effects and several seasons of historical data. Prophet is robust to missing
data and shifts in the trend, and typically handles outliers well."

<h2>Predicting Future Price Using Text Data and Natural Language Processing</h2>
You can read about how we developed a system to read in a quarterly earnings
call transcript and use it to predict the next day's stock price.
