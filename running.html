<h1>I try to run consistently.</h1>
<h3>Shoes</h3>
I have a pair of Asics that have lasted me over a year and a half that I do the majority of my running in. <br>
I have a pair of NewBalance 860v8s that also do well. <br>

<h3>Running Social Networks</h3>
I am a big fan of the app Strava. Simply download the app and connect with other athletes. You can sync activities with your Apple Watch seamlessly.<br>
